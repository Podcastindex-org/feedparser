### Session Summary — 2025-12-09

#### Triggering Prompts / Issue
- User provided project guidelines and requested: "Add support for the RSS 2.0 <language> tag at the <channel> level."

#### Changes Implemented
1. Parser state
   - Added `channel_language: String` to `src/parser_state.rs`.

2. Tag handling
   - Created new handler `src/tags/language.rs` with `on_text` to capture channel-level `<language>` text when inside `<channel>` and not inside an item or channel image.
   - Registered the handler in `src/tags/mod.rs` (`pub mod language;`) and routed text via `dispatch_text` for element name `"language"`.
   - Updated `src/tags/channel.rs::on_start` to clear `channel_language` at the beginning of each `<channel>`.

3. Outputs (newsfeeds schema)
   - Updated `src/outputs.rs::write_newsfeeds` to include a new `"language"` column and write `state.channel_language.trim()`.
   - Updated the empty-XML fallback record in `src/main.rs` to add the `language` column with an empty string value to keep schemas consistent.

4. Tests
   - Added a new unit test `writes_channel_language_to_newsfeeds_output` in `src/main.rs` to verify `<language>` is parsed and written (trimmed) to `newsfeeds`.
   - Fixed an incidental inconsistency by trimming `item_itunes_author` in `write_nfitems` (improved normalization) to keep tests passing consistently.

5. Documentation
   - Updated `.junie/guidelines.md` JSON Schemas section to include `itunes_author` and the new `language` column in `newsfeeds`, and to list `itunes_author` for `nfitems`. Documented trimming behavior for the new field.

#### Build & Test
- Ran `cargo build` — success.
- Ran `cargo test` — all tests passed (7/7).

#### Notes
- The channel `<language>` is captured as-is from the feed and trimmed at write time (e.g., `en`, `en-US`, `nl`).
- CDATA for `<language>` is handled the same as text, consistent with other handlers.
